<p > <pre>lorem can be used in a paragraph
  that you don't have any idea what to write in class. <br>
  Attributes are used within  the tags (not between the tags). <br> The class starts as from
   11.00 am and stops at 2.00 pm
i enjoy being in this and moreover is that i can interact with my friend from different schools.
  How i wish we could continue this way till the end. </pre> <br>
 <q>The worst thing isn't the goodbye that we usually say after every
course, but the flashback that follows.</q>  that is what i keep on thinking every now and then as i usually pack my thing ready to go home</p>
