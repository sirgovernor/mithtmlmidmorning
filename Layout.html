    <h1>Nairobi</h1>
<p>Nairobi is the capital and largest city of Kenya. The name is derived from
  the Maasai phrase Enkare Nairobi, which translates to "place of cool waters",</p>
<p>Nairobi is Kenyaâ€™s capital city. In addition to its urban core, the city has Nairobi National Park,
  a large game reserve known for breeding endangered black rhinos and home to giraffes, zebras and lions.
